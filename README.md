## Overview

My very first solution for Frontend Mentor. 
I'm only learning HTML and CSS, so I think my solution is a bit 'meh..', though I don't know yet what I could have done better.

My solution looks very close to the task (you can find desings in the design folder):

Tried to practice flexbox.
It actually happened to be not that successful for me since I wasn't able to center that background :(
I have to thank guys from https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css


If you have any tips how to improve such beginner approach - I would be happy to know them.
